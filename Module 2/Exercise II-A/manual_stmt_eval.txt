Consider the following statement:
a = 4 * 3 / 4 + 4 / 4 + 8 - 2 + 5 / 8
Evaluate this expression manually and then find the value of a?

Sol.    a = 4 * 3 / 4 + 4 / 4 + 8 - 2 + 5 / 8
	Here '*' operator and '/' operator have same precedence. Therefore, 
	we will see the associativity, i.e. from Left to Right.
	
	So Let's solve the expression using brackets().
	a = ((4 * 3) / 4) + (4 / 4) + 8 - 2 + (5 / 8)
	a = (12 / 4) + 1 + 8 - 2 + 0.625
	a = 3 + 1 + 8 - 2 + 0.625
	a = 4 + 8 - 2 + 0.625
	a = 12 - 2 + 0.625
	a = 10 + 0.625
	a = 10.625
Ans. The value of a is 10.625
